  "content": "Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to transformer architecture optimization for natural language understanding tasks. We introduce a new attention mechanism that reduces computational complexity while maintaining performance across multiple benchmarks. Our experiments show a 15% improvement in efficiency with comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art models.",
